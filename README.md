# Solar-Power-Output-Prediction-Usin-Linear-Regression
This project aims to predict solar power generation using a linear regression model. Solar power is a crucial renewable energy source, and accurate forecasting is essential for grid stability and efficient energy management. By analyzing historical weather data, such as temperature, humidity, we can develop a model to predict output.
